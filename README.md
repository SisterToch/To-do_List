This is a to-do list project, and i will be listing every feature it has. I hope you enjoy iT.
While perusing, you will realize that i didnt use append where should have, and instead used ".insert". This is because tkinter listbox widget is a part of the GUI, responsoble for displayin the tasks in an organized manner. It doesnt treat the tasks as one whole, but different items.
